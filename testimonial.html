						<p>Got my truck fixed over a year ago. Was a pretty big job. I spent more money at other places while truck was not repaired! Then I found S & D. PROBLEM SOLVED FOR LESS. They also repaired my mom and dad's exhaust system on the wheelchair van for free while working only truck. My parents insisted they get paid something and still were refused on their offer. Both of my parents are retired and disabled. What a great gesture. We all are happy to have their services. Thank you to all at S&D Automotive.</p>

						<p>There is only one shop which I trust my automotive repair needs with and that is S & D Auto Repair.  They always perform superior service while not taking all my money.  I have been going to this shop ever since it opened up and I plan to continue to do so in the near future.  I highly recommend S & D Auto Repair!</p>
